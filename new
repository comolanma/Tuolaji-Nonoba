I am working on a game where I want to send private messages through the chat system. 
I am experimenting with overloading the HandleChatMessage() method,
however I can not figure out how to display the text message to only 1 user. Any ideas?
 
For the user who typed the message, 
Player.send("chathandled", msg) 

To send it to a user who is not the one who typed it, 
have some code take the second string in the array
 and place it into the variable "usertosend" 

So if the command is /message Cyclone103 Hi! How are you? 
it will parse Cyclone103 as usertosend. 
Concatenate everything past the second part into a single string, msg. 

Use this code on the serverside: 

Broadcast("messagerecieved", usertosend, msg) 

Have the clientside code check if the current user has the username stored in usertosend,
 if they don't, it should not do anything to the message and it should not parse it. 

If they do, use the addChildToChat method and add the text. 

My new Question is what did you do for NonobaAPI.AddChildToChat(s:Sprite)?

Yes you can do this, but make sure the flash player are allowd to connect to the network. 
if you are useing "Flash" to compile the movie you can set this in the project settings 
"Local playback securty" to "Access network only".
